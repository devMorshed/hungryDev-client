# Hungry Dev App
This app is a basic React app that I built to demonstrate my skills in building web applications using React.

## Features
- The app has a responsive design that works well on both desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
- It uses React Router for client-side routing.
- It uses Express to make HTTP requests for API.
- It uses Firebase authentication for user management.
- It uses TailwindCSS to provide a responsive and modern UI and make it super customiseable.
- It is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and maintain.
